#System_calls in Linux are procedures that provide the interface between a process and the operating system. ***They are the way by which a computer program requests a service from the kernel of the operating system, such as accessing a file, a device, or a network resource***. Different operating systems execute different system calls, and the details of how to make a system call vary from architecture to architecture.

- The user program prepares the arguments for the system call and stores them in registers or on the stack.
- The user program executes a special instruction (such as syscall, int, or sysenter) that switches the processor from user mode to kernel mode and transfers the control to a predefined address in the kernel.
- The kernel checks the validity of the system call number and the arguments, and then dispatches the system call to the appropriate handler function (kernel search in syscall table).
- The handler function performs the requested service, such as accessing a file, a device, or a network resource, and returns a status code and a result value (if any) to the user program.
- The kernel restores the processor state and switches back to user mode, resuming the execution of the user program from where it left off.

A system call table is a data structure that maps system call numbers to the corresponding kernel functions that implement them. The system call table is usually a text file that lists the system call number, the name of the kernel function that implements it, and the name of the user-level wrapper function that invokes it. [For example, this is an excerpt from the x86_64 system call table](https://blog.rchapman.org/posts/Linux_System_Call_Table_for_x86_64/)[1](https://blog.rchapman.org/posts/Linux_System_Call_Table_for_x86_64/):

```
0	common	read			sys_read
1	common	write			sys_write
2	common	open			sys_open
3	common	close			sys_close
4	common	stat			sys_newstat
5	common	fstat			sys_newfstat
6	common	lstat			sys_newlstat
7	common	poll			sys_poll
8	common	lseek			sys_lseek
9	common	mmap			sys_mmap
10	common	mprotect		sys_mprotect
11	common	munmap			sys_munmap
12	common	brk			    sys_brk
13	common	rt_sigaction	sys_rt_sigaction
14	common	rt_sigprocmask	sys_rt_sigprocmask
15	common	rt_sigreturn	sys_rt_sigreturn
```

The first column is the system call number, which is passed to the kernel by the user program in a register (usually %rax for x86_64). The second column is the ABI (Application Binary Interface) name, which indicates whether the system call is common to all architectures (common), specific to one architecture (x32 or x86), or compatible with an older version of Linux (compact). The fourth column is the name of the kernel function that implements the system call, which usually starts with sys_ and has a descriptive name. The third column is the name of the user-level wrapper function that invokes the system call, which usually matches the name of the corresponding C library function or system call manual page.
