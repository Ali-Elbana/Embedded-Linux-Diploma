A process in Linux is a program that is running on your system. It can be a command that you enter in the terminal, a graphical application that you launch, or a background service that runs automatically. Every process has a unique identifier called a PID (process ID) that the system uses to manage it. You can use various commands and tools to view, control, and manipulate processes in Linux. For example, you can use the <font color="red">ps</font> command to list the processes that are currently running on your system. You can also use the top command to see the processes that are using the most CPU and memory resources.

Signals are a way of sending notifications to processes in Linux. They can be used to interrupt, terminate, resume, or perform other actions on a process. Signals can be sent by the kernel, by other processes, or by the process itself. There are different types of signals, each with a name and a number. Some signals can be handled by the process, while others cannot be ignored or blocked.

For example, the signal SIGINT (number 2) is sent to a process when the user presses Ctrl + C on the keyboard. This signal usually causes the process to stop and return to the shell prompt. The process can choose to handle this signal differently, or ignore it altogether. The signal SIGKILL (number 9) is sent to a process when the user wants to force it to terminate immediately. This signal cannot be handled or ignored by the process, and it will always end the process.
