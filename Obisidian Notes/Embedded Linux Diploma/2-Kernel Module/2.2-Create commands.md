Commands in Linux are programs that run on the Linux command line interface (CLI). 
They are executed by entering them in the terminal and pressing ‘Enter’. These commands help you perform various tasks, such as navigating through files and directories, managing users and processes, installing and removing packages, and more.

## <font color="yellow"><u>Creating a command:</u></f>

**We now want to create a command and run it like <font color="green">cd</f> on the terminal, we will create it using C++ as following:**

```main.cpp
#include <iostream>

/*
this library stands for unix standard, it provides access to the POSIX operating system API. POSIX stands for Portable Operating System Interface, and it is a family of standards for maintaining compatibility between operating systems. The unistd.h file contains various functions that are related to signals, filesystem access, process control, user identification, encryption, configuration, and more.
*/
#include <unistd.h> 

/*
The sys/types.h header file contains various type definitions and declarations that are used by other system headers, such as sys/stat.h, sys/socket.h, sys/wait.h, etc. Some examples of these types are:
	pid_t: This type represents a process ID.
	size_t: This type represents the size of an object in bytes.
	off_t: This type represents a file offset or size.
	mode_t: This type represents a file mode or permission.
	time_t: This type represents a calendar time or date.
	uid_t: This type represents a user ID.
	gid_t: This type represents a group ID.
*/
#include <sys/types.h>

using namespace std ;

int main(void)
{
	cout << "User ID: " << getuid() << endl ;
}

```

**After that you run this command: <font color="red">g++ main.cpp -o userid</f>.

	an exe file will be generated run it to make sure the program is correct.

**Now to make this command executed from the terminal we want to copy it to the path of the fetched ones when writing a command.

	-To know the path being fetched when executing a command run this command: echo $PATH.
	-The output: /root/bin:/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin
	:/usr/games:/usr/local/games:/snap/bin
	-Choose one of these commands which are separated with : and copy the userid.exe on it.
	-To do that execute this command: sudo cp userid /usr/bin
