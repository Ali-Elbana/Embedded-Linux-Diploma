## <font color="yellow"><u>Definition:</u></f>

A network is a way of connecting two or more devices or systems so that they can communicate and share data or resources. A network can be small, such as a home Wi-Fi network, or large, such as the Internet. A network can use different types of cables, wireless signals, or other technologies to link the devices or systems together. A network can also have different structures, such as peer-to-peer, where all participants have equal privileges, or client-server, where one central device provides services to the others.

## <font color="yellow"><u>What is Modem?</u></f>

[Modem](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/how-to-install-a-modem/) stands for Modulator/Demodulator. The modem is defined as a [networking device](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/network-devices-hub-repeater-bridge-switch-router-gateways/) that is used to connect devices connected in the network to the [internet](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/internet-and-its-services/). The main function of a modem is to convert the [analog signals](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/advantages-and-disadvantages-of-analog-signals/) that come from telephone wire into a digital form. In digital form, these converted signals are stored in the form of 0s and 1s. The modem can perform both the task of [modulation](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/what-is-modulation/) and demodulation simultaneously. Modems are majorly used to transfer digital data in personal systems. The modem is also known as a signal translator as it translates one signal into another signal by modulating the [digital signal](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/advantages-and-disadvantages-of-digital-signals/) into an analog signal for transmission and then demodulates receiving analog signals into digital signals.

Some common types of modems are:
- Dial-up modems, which use phone lines to transmit data at very low speeds (up to 56 kbps). These modems are rarely used today.
- DSL modems, which also use phone lines but at different frequencies, allowing simultaneous phone calls and internet access. These modems can reach speeds up to 100 Mbps, but the actual speed depends on the distance from the ISP’s station.
- Cable modems, which use coaxial cables to transmit data at high speeds (up to 1 Gbps). These modems share bandwidth with other users in the same area, which may affect the speed during peak hours.
- Fiber optic modems, which use thin strands of glass or plastic to transmit data using light signals. These modems offer the fastest and most reliable internet connection (up to 10 Gbps), but they are also the most expensive and not widely available.

## <font color="yellow"><u>What is Router?</u></f>

A Router is a [networking device](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/network-devices-hub-repeater-bridge-switch-router-gateways/) that forwards data packets between [computer networks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/basics-computer-networking/). One or more [packet-switched networks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/packet-switched-network-psn-in-networking/) or subnetworks can be connected using a router. By sending data packets to their intended [IP addresses](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/what-is-an-ip-address/), it manages traffic between different networks and permits several devices to share an [Internet connection](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/types-of-internet-connection/).

Let us understand this by a very general example, suppose you search for _www.google.com__ in your web browser then this will be a request which will be sent from your system to Google's server to serve that webpage, now your request which is nothing but a stream of packets don't just go to the Google's server straightaway they go through a series of networking devices known as a router which accepts these packets and forwards them to correct path and hence it reaches to the destination server. A router has several interfaces by which it can connect to several host systems.
#### How Does Router Work?
A router determines a packet’s future path by examining the destination IP address of the header and comparing it to the routing [database](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/what-is-database/). The list of [routing tables](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/routing-tables-in-computer-network/) outlines how to send the data to a specific network location. They use a set of rules to determine the most effective way to transmit the [data](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/what-is-data/) to the specified IP address.

A routing table primarily specifies the router’s default path. As a result, it might not determine the optimum path to forward the data for a particular packet. For instance, the office router directs all networks to its internet service provider through a single default channel.

Static and dynamic tables come in two varieties in the router. The [dynamic routing](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/what-is-dynamic-routing-in-computer-network/) tables are automatically updated by dynamic routers based on network activity, whereas the [static routing tables](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/difference-between-static-and-dynamic-routing/) are configured manually.
#### Types of Router
There are several types of routers available in the market. Some of them are mentioned below:
1. ***Broadband Routers:*** These are one of the important kinds of routers. It is used to do different types of things. it is used to connect [computers](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/types-of-computers/) or it is also used to connect to the internet.
2. ***Wireless routers:*** These routers are used to create a wireless signal in your office or home. Wireless routers receive data packets over wired broadband, convert the packets written in binary code into radio signals that are picked up by electronic devices, and then convert them back into previous packets. 
3. ***Edge Routers****: As the name indicates, these are located at the edges usually connected to an [Internet Service Provider](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/isp-full-form/), and distribute packets across multiple packets.
4. ***Core Routers:** Core routers distribute packets within the same network. The main task is to carry heavy data transfers.
#### Architecture of Router 
A generic router consists of the following components:

## <font color="yellow"><u>What is Switch?</u></f>

A switch is a device that connects and forwards data packets between different devices on a network, such as computers, printers, servers, etc. A switch can improve the performance and efficiency of a network by sending data only to the intended device, rather than broadcasting it to all devices. A switch can also divide a network into smaller segments, called subnets or VLANs, to reduce congestion and increase security.

There are different types of switches that operate at different layers of the OSI model and have different features and functions. For example, a layer 2 switch uses MAC addresses to forward data, while a layer 3 switch uses IP addresses. A managed switch allows network administrators to configure and monitor the switch, while an unmanaged switch does not. A PoE switch can provide power to devices over Ethernet cables, while a virtual switch can connect virtual machines within a host environment.
#### How Does a Network Switch Works?
When the source wants to send the data packet to the destination, the packet first enters the switch and the switch reads its header and finds the MAC address of the destination to identify the device then it sends the packet out through the appropriate ports that lead to the destination devices.

Switch establishes a temporary connection between the source and destination for communication and terminates the connection once the conversation is done. Also, it offers full bandwidth to network traffic going to and from a device simultaneously to reduce collision.

![How Does a Network Switch Works?](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20230511171149/Network-Switch-01-copy-660.webp)

#### Difference between Network Switch and Hub:
|Network Switch|Hub|
|---|---|
|Network Switch is a device of layer 2 of the OSI Model.|Hub is a physical device of Layer 1 of the OSI Model.|
|Network Switch is a little more complex than a Hub.|Hub is a simple device as compared to Network Switch.|
|Network Switch easily manages data in and out, hence less communication collision.|Communication Collisions usually happen in a Hub.|
|Network Switches transfer data together by connecting devices.|The main task of Hub is to connect all nodes of the network.|
|Switches prevent collision with the help of [Ethernet frames](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/ethernet-frame-format/).|Hubs cannot help in preventing collisions.|

## <font color="yellow"><u>What is NIC?</u></f>

A network interface card (NIC) is a hardware component, typically a circuit board or chip, which is installed on a computer so that it can connect to a network. Modern NICs provide functionality to computers such as support for I/O interrupt, direct memory access (DMA) interfaces, data transmission, network traffic engineering partitioning.

A NIC provides a computer with a dedicated, full-time connection to a network by implementing the physical layer circuitry necessary for communicating with a data link layer standard, such as Ethernet or Wi-Fi. Each card represents a device and can prepare, transmit and control the flow of data on the network. The NIC uses the OSI model to send signals at the physical layer, transmit data packets at the network layer and operate as an interface at the TCP/IP layer.

The network card operates as a middleman between a computer and a data network. For example, when a user requests a web page, the computer will pass the request to the network card which converts it into electrical impulses. Those impulses are received by a web server on the internet and by sending the web page back to the network card as electrical signals. The card gets these signals and translates them into the data that the computer displays.

Originally, network controllers were implemented as expansion cards that could be plugged into a computer port, router or USB device. However, more modern controllers are built directly into the computer motherboard chipset.

## <font color="yellow"><u>What is MAC?</u></f>

MAC stands for Media Access Control, and it is a unique identifier assigned to a network interface controller (NIC) for use as a network address in communications within a network segment. MAC addresses are used to identify and direct data packets to the correct devices on a network, such as computers, routers, and switches. MAC addresses are also known as physical addresses, hardware addresses, or Ethernet addresses. MAC addresses are 12-digit hexadecimal numbers, usually separated by colons or hyphens, such as 00:14:22:01:23:45 or 00-14-22-01-23-45. The first six digits of a MAC address indicate the manufacturer of the device, while the last six digits are assigned by the manufacturer to each device. MAC addresses are different from IP addresses, which are logical addresses that indicate the location of a device on the internet. MAC addresses work at the data link layer of the OSI model, while IP addresses work at the network layer. You can learn more about MAC addresses and how they work by reading the web search results that I have provided for you.

## <font color="yellow"><u>What is HTTP?</u></f>

HTTP is a protocol that allows web browsers and web servers to communicate with each other over the internet. HTTP stands for HyperText Transfer Protocol, which means it transfers hypertext documents, such as HTML pages, that can contain links to other resources. HTTP is based on a request-response model, where the browser sends a request for a resource to the server, and the server sends back a response with the resource or an error message. HTTP is an application layer protocol, which means it works on top of other protocols that handle the lower-level details of data transmission, such as TCP/IP.

![[HTTP working principle.png]]

Some of the main features and functions of HTTP are:
- It is **stateless**, which means each request and response are independent and do not keep any information about previous interactions. However, some mechanisms, such as cookies and sessions, can be used to store state information on the client or server side.
- It supports different **methods**, such as GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc., to indicate the action that the browser wants to perform on the resource. For example, GET is used to retrieve a resource, while POST is used to send data to the server.
- It uses **URLs** (Uniform Resource Locators) to identify and locate resources on the web. A URL consists of several components, such as the scheme (http or https), the host name (www.example.com), the path (/index.html), and the query string (?q=hello).
- It defines a standard **format** for both requests and responses. A request consists of a request line (method, URL, and HTTP version), optional headers (key-value pairs that provide additional information), and an optional body (data sent to the server). A response consists of a status line (HTTP version, status code, and status message), optional headers, and an optional body (data returned by the server).
- It uses **status codes** to indicate the result of a request. There are five classes of status codes: 1xx (informational), 2xx (success), 3xx (redirection), 4xx (client error), and 5xx (server error). Some common status codes are 200 (OK), 301 (Moved Permanently), 404 (Not Found), and 500 (Internal Server Error).
- It supports **multiple media types** to describe the format and characteristics of the data in the body of a request or response. Media types are also known as MIME types (Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions) and consist of a type and a subtype, such as text/html, image/jpeg, or application/json.
- It allows **caching** of resources to improve performance and reduce network traffic. Caching can be done by browsers or intermediate proxies that store copies of frequently requested resources. HTTP provides headers, such as Cache-Control, Expires, and ETag, to control how caching is done.
- It can be **secured** by using HTTPS (HTTP Secure), which is a variant of HTTP that uses SSL/TLS encryption to protect the data in transit. HTTPS can prevent eavesdropping, tampering, and impersonation attacks by verifying the identity of the server and encrypting the communication.

## <font color="yellow"><u>What is Socket?</u></f>

A socket in networking is a way of connecting two programs or devices on a network so that they can exchange data. A socket is like an address that specifies where the data should go and how it should be delivered. A socket consists of three parts: a protocol, an IP address, and a port number. The protocol is the set of rules that defines how the data is formatted and transmitted. The IP address is the unique identifier of the device or program on the network. The port number is a number that distinguishes different applications or services on the same device or program.

There are two main types of sockets in networking: datagram sockets and stream sockets. Datagram sockets are used for sending and receiving packets of data without establishing a connection. They are fast and simple, but they do not guarantee that the data will arrive in order or without errors. Stream sockets are used for sending and receiving streams of data after establishing a connection. They are reliable and orderly, but they require more overhead and complexity.

---
## <font color="yellow"><u>What is Port?</u></f>

A port in networking is a way of identifying and directing data to a specific service or application on a device that is connected to a network. A port is like a door that allows data to enter or exit a device. A port has a number that is associated with a protocol, such as TCP or UDP, and an IP address, such as 192.168.1.1. The combination of the protocol, the IP address, and the port number forms a socket, which is the endpoint of a network communication.

There are different types of ports in networking, depending on their function and range. Some common types are:
- **Well-known ports** are ports that are reserved for standard and widely used services, such as HTTP (port 80), FTP (port 21), or SSH (port 22). These ports have numbers from 0 to 1023 and are assigned by the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA).
- **Registered ports** are ports that are registered for specific services or applications that are not as common as well-known ports, such as Skype (port 1024), Minecraft (port 25565), or Spotify (port 4070). These ports have numbers from 1024 to 49151 and are also assigned by the IANA.
- **Ephemeral ports** are ports that are used for temporary and random connections between devices, such as when a web browser requests a webpage from a web server. These ports have numbers from 49152 to 65535 and are chosen by the operating system of the device.

Ports in networking help devices to efficiently manage and process different types of data that flow over the network. Ports also help to improve security and performance by allowing network administrators to control which services or applications can access the network and how much bandwidth they can use.

## <font color="yellow"><u>What is TCP?</u></f>

TCP is a protocol that enables application programs and computing devices to exchange messages over a network. [It is designed to send packets across the internet and ensure the successful delivery of data and messages over networks](https://www.fortinet.com/resources/cyberglossary/tcp-ip)[1](https://www.fortinet.com/resources/cyberglossary/tcp-ip).

TCP stands for Transmission Control Protocol, which means it controls how the data is transmitted and received. TCP is a connection-oriented protocol, which means it establishes a connection between the sender and the receiver before sending any data. TCP also provides reliable delivery of data, which means it checks for errors, losses, duplicates, and delays in the data transmission. [TCP uses mechanisms such as sequence numbers, acknowledgement numbers, checksums, and timers to achieve this reliability](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/what-is-transmission-control-protocol-tcp/)[2](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/what-is-transmission-control-protocol-tcp/)[3](https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computers-and-internet/xcae6f4a7ff015e7d:the-internet/xcae6f4a7ff015e7d:transporting-packets/a/transmission-control-protocol--tcp)[4](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmission_Control_Protocol).

![[TCP protocol.png]]

TCP is one of the main protocols of the Internet protocol suite, which is a collection of protocols that define the standards for communicating over the internet. TCP works with another protocol called IP (Internet Protocol), which handles the routing and addressing of packets. [Together, TCP and IP form the basis of the internet and are sometimes referred to as TCP/IP](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/tcp-ip-in-computer-networking/)[5](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/tcp-ip-in-computer-networking/).

---
## <font color="yellow"><u>What is UDP?</u></f>

UDP is a protocol that enables fast and efficient communication over the internet. It is used for applications that require real-time data transmission, such as video streaming, online gaming, or voice calls. UDP does not establish a connection before sending data, nor does it check for errors or losses in the data. This makes UDP faster than TCP, another protocol that provides reliable and ordered data delivery, but also less reliable. UDP is sometimes called Unreliable Datagram Protocol because of this trade-off.

![[UDP protocol.png]]

UDP works by sending packets of data, called datagrams, from one device to another on a network. Each datagram contains a header and a payload. The header includes the source and destination IP addresses and port numbers, which identify the devices and applications involved in the communication. The payload contains the actual data to be transferred. UDP does not include any information about the order or sequence of the datagrams, so they may arrive out of order or be duplicated or lost. UDP also does not include any mechanism for acknowledging or retransmitting datagrams, so it is up to the application layer to handle any errors or losses.

## <font color="yellow"><u>What is Ethernet?</u></f>

Ethernet is a technology that allows devices to communicate with each other over a wired network. Ethernet uses cables, such as twisted pair or fiber optic, to connect devices, such as computers, routers, and switches. Ethernet also defines the rules and formats for sending and receiving data packets between devices. Ethernet is the most common type of local area network (LAN) technology, but it can also be used for wide area networks (WANs) and metropolitan area networks (MANs). [Ethernet is fast, reliable, and secure, and it supports different speeds and standards](https://bing.com/search?q=What+is+Ethernet%3f)[1](https://bing.com/search?q=What+is+Ethernet%3f)[2](https://www.wired.com/story/what-is-ethernet/)[3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethernet)

Some of the main features and benefits of Ethernet are:
- It is **simple** and **easy** to set up and use. You just need to plug the Ethernet cable into the device and the router or switch.
- It is **fast** and **efficient**, as it can transfer data at high speeds without interference or congestion. The latest Ethernet standard can support up to 400 Gbps.
- It is **reliable** and **stable**, as it does not depend on wireless signals or environmental factors. It also checks for errors and losses in the data transmission and retransmits them if necessary.
- It is **secure** and **private**, as it does not broadcast data over the air. It also allows encryption and authentication of the data.

## <font color="yellow"><u>What is ARP?</u></f>

ARP is a network protocol that allows devices to find out the physical address, such as a MAC address, of another device on the same network, given its IP address. ARP is used when a device wants to send data to another device on a local network, such as an Ethernet network, but does not know its MAC address. ARP works by broadcasting a request packet to all devices on the network, asking for the MAC address of the device with the specified IP address. The device that has that IP address responds with its MAC address, and the sender can then use that MAC address to send data to the destination. ARP is a critical function in the Internet protocol suite, as it enables devices to communicate with each other over a network.

## <font color="yellow"><u>What is OSI model?</u></f>

#### <font color="green0"><u>Definition:</u></f>

**OSI stands for Open Systems Interconnection**. It was developed by ISO – ‘International Organization for Standardization’, in the year 1984. It is a 7-layer architecture with each layer having specific functionality to perform. All these 7 layers work collaboratively to transmit the data from one person to another across the globe.

![[OSI layers.png]]
#### <font color="green0"><u>Physical Layer – Layer 1:</u></f>
The lowest layer of the OSI reference model is the physical layer. It is responsible for the actual physical connection between the devices. The physical layer contains information in the form of **bits.** It is responsible for transmitting individual bits from one node to the next. When receiving data, this layer will get the signal received and convert it into 0s and 1s and send them to the Data Link layer, which will put the frame back together.

![[Representation of the data sent to  the physical layer.png]]
#### Functions of the Physical Layer:
- **Bit synchronization:** The physical layer provides the synchronization of the bits by providing a clock. This clock controls both sender and receiver thus providing synchronization at the bit level.
- **Bit rate control:** The Physical layer also defines the transmission rate i.e. the number of bits sent per second.
- **Physical topologies:** Physical layer specifies how the different, devices/nodes are arranged in a network i.e. bus, star, or mesh topology.
- **Transmission mode:** Physical layer also defines how the data flows between the two connected devices. The various transmission modes possible are Simplex, half-duplex and full-duplex.

> **Note:**
> 
> 1. Hub, Repeater, Modem, and Cables are Physical Layer devices. 
> 2. Network Layer, Data Link Layer, and Physical Layer are also known as **Lower Layers** or **Hardware Layers**.

#### <font color="green0"><u>Data Link Layer (DLL) – Layer 2:</u></f>
The data link layer is responsible for the node-to-node delivery of the message. The main function of this layer is to make sure data transfer is error-free from one node to another, over the physical layer. When a packet arrives in a network, it is the responsibility of the DLL to transmit it to the Host using its MAC address.   
The Data Link Layer is divided into two sublayers:  
1. [Logical Link Control (LLC)](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/logical-link-control-llc-protocol-data-unit/)
2. [Media Access Control (MAC)](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/introduction-of-mac-address-in-computer-network/)

The packet received from the Network layer is further divided into frames depending on the frame size of the NIC(Network Interface Card). DLL also encapsulates Sender and Receiver’s MAC address in the header. 

The Receiver’s MAC address is obtained by placing an [ARP(Address Resolution Protocol)](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/how-address-resolution-protocol-arp-works/) request onto the wire asking “Who has that IP address?” and the destination host will reply with its MAC address.  
##### Functions of the Data Link Layer:
- **Framing:** Framing is a function of the data link layer. It provides a way for a sender to transmit a set of bits that are meaningful to the receiver. This can be accomplished by attaching special bit patterns to the beginning and end of the frame.
- **Physical addressing:** After creating frames, the Data link layer adds physical addresses (MAC addresses) of the sender and/or receiver in the header of each frame.
- **Error control:** The data link layer provides the mechanism of error control in which it detects and retransmits damaged or lost frames.
- **Flow Control:** The data rate must be constant on both sides else the data may get corrupted thus, flow control coordinates the amount of data that can be sent before receiving an acknowledgment.
- **Access control:** When a single communication channel is shared by multiple devices, the MAC sub-layer of the data link layer helps to determine which device has control over the channel at a given time.

![Function of DLL](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20230405130015/DatalinkLayer-660x335.jpg)

> **Note:**
> 
> 1. Packet in the Data Link layer is referred to as **Frame.** 
> 2. Data Link layer is handled by the NIC (Network Interface Card) and device drivers of host machines. 
> 3. Switch & Bridge are Data Link Layer devices.

#### <font color="green0"><u>Network Layer – Layer 3:</u></f>
The network layer works for the transmission of data from one host to the other located in different networks. It also takes care of packet routing i.e. selection of the shortest path to transmit the packet, from the number of routes available. The sender & receiver’s IP addresses are placed in the header by the network layer. 
#### Functions of the Network Layer:
- **Routing:** The network layer protocols determine which route is suitable from source to destination. This function of the network layer is known as routing.
- **Logical Addressing:** To identify each device on Internetwork uniquely, the network layer defines an addressing scheme. The sender & receiver’s IP addresses are placed in the header by the network layer. Such an address distinguishes each device uniquely and universally.

> **Note:**
> 
> 1. Segment in the Network layer is referred to as **Packet**. 
> 2. Network layer is implemented by networking devices such as routers and switches.

#### <font color="green0"><u>Transport Layer – Layer 4:</u></f>
The transport layer provides services to the application layer and takes services from the network layer. The data in the transport layer is referred to as _Segments_. It is responsible for the End to End Delivery of the complete message. The transport layer also provides the acknowledgment of the successful data transmission and re-transmits the data if an error is found.

> **Note:** The sender needs to know the port number associated with the receiver’s application. 
> 
> Generally, this destination port number is configured, either by default or manually. For example, when a web application requests a web server, it typically uses port number 80, because this is the default port assigned to web applications. Many applications have default ports assigned. 
> 
> **At the receiver’s side:** Transport Layer reads the port number from its header and forwards the Data which it has received to the respective application. It also performs sequencing and reassembling of the segmented data. 

#### Functions of the Transport Layer:
- **Segmentation and Reassembly:** This layer accepts the message from the (session) layer, and breaks the message into smaller units. Each of the segments produced has a header associated with it. The transport layer at the destination station reassembles the message.
- **Service Point Addressing:** To deliver the message to the correct process, the transport layer header includes a type of address called service point address or port address. Thus by specifying this address, the transport layer makes sure that the message is delivered to the correct process.
#### <font color="green0"><u>Session Layer – Layer 5:</u></f>
This layer is responsible for the establishment of connection, maintenance of sessions, and authentication, and also ensures security.
#### Functions of the Session Layer:
- **Session establishment, maintenance, and termination:** The layer allows the two processes to establish, use and terminate a connection.
- **Synchronization:** This layer allows a process to add checkpoints that are considered synchronization points in the data. These synchronization points help to identify the error so that the data is re-synchronized properly, and ends of the messages are not cut prematurely and data loss is avoided.
- **Dialog Controller:** The session layer allows two systems to start communication with each other in half-duplex or full-duplex.

> **Note:**
> 
> 1. All the below 3 layers(including Session Layer) are integrated as a single layer in the TCP/IP model as the ''Application Layer''. 
> 2. Implementation of these 3 layers is done by the network application itself. These are also known as **Upper Layers or** **Software Layers.** 
> 3. **Device or Protocol Use :**  NetBIOS, PPTP.

**for Example:-**
Let us consider a scenario where a user wants to send a message through some Messenger application running in his browser. The “Messenger” here acts as the application layer which provides the user with an interface to create the data. This message or so-called Data is compressed, encrypted (if any secure data), and converted into bits (0’s and 1’s) so that it can be transmitted.  

![Communication in Session Layer](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20230405124947/communication.jpg)

#### <font color="green0"><u>Presentation Layer – Layer 6:</u></f>
The presentation layer is also called the **Translation layer**. The data from the application layer is extracted here and manipulated as per the required format to transmit over the network. 
#### Functions of the Presentation Layer:
- **Translation:** For example, ASCII to EBCDIC.
- **Encryption/ Decryption:** Data encryption translates the data into another form or code. The encrypted data is known as the ciphertext and the decrypted data is known as plain text. A key value is used for encrypting as well as decrypting data.
- **Compression:** Reduces the number of bits that need to be transmitted on the network.

Note: **Device or Protocol Use :**  JPEG, MPEG, GIF

#### <font color="green0"><u>Application Layer – Layer 7:</u></f>
At the very top of the OSI Reference Model stack of layers, we find the Application layer which is implemented by the network applications. These applications produce the data, which has to be transferred over the network. This layer also serves as a window for the application services to access the network and for displaying the received information to the user. 

**Example**: Application – Browsers, Skype Messenger, etc. 

> **Note:** 
> 
> 1. The application Layer is also called Desktop Layer.  
> 2.  **Device or Protocol Use :**  SMTP

#### Functions of the Application Layer:
The main functions of application layer are given below.
- Network Virtual Terminal: It allows a user to log on to a remote host.
- FTAM- File transfer access and management : This application allows a user to  
    access file in a remote host, retrieve files in remote host and manage or  
    control files from a remote computer.
- Mail Services : Provide email service.
- Directory Services : This application provides distributed database sources  
    and access for global information about various objects and services.

> **Note:** OSI model acts as a reference model and is not implemented on the Internet because of its late invention. The current model being used is the TCP/IP model.

A network stack in Linux is a set of software components that enable the communication of applications with the physical network devices. The network stack is divided into multiple layers, each performing a specific function and interacting with the adjacent layers. [The network stack in Linux follows the TCP/IP model, which consists of five layers: application, transport, network, data link, and physical](https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/networking/scaling.html)[1](https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/networking/scaling.html)[2](https://www.educba.com/linux-network-stack/).

The application layer is the highest layer of the network stack, where the applications that use the network services reside. Examples of application layer protocols are HTTP, FTP, SMTP, DNS, etc. [The application layer communicates with the transport layer through the socket interface, which is a system call interface that allows applications to create and manipulate network endpoints](https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/networking/scaling.html)[1](https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/networking/scaling.html)[2](https://www.educba.com/linux-network-stack/).

The transport layer is responsible for providing reliable or unreliable data delivery between applications. Examples of transport layer protocols are TCP and UDP. [The transport layer communicates with the network layer through the protocol agnostic interface, which is a generic interface that allows different transport protocols to share common functions](https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/networking/scaling.html)[1](https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/networking/scaling.html)[2](https://www.educba.com/linux-network-stack/).

The network layer is responsible for providing logical addressing and routing of packets across different networks. Examples of network layer protocols are IP, ICMP, ARP, etc. [The network layer communicates with the data link layer through the device agnostic interface, which is an abstract interface that allows different network devices to share common functions](https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/networking/scaling.html)[1](https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/networking/scaling.html)[2](https://www.educba.com/linux-network-stack/).

The data link layer is responsible for providing physical addressing and error detection of frames within a single network. Examples of data link layer protocols are Ethernet, Wi-Fi, PPP, etc. [The data link layer communicates with the physical layer through the device drivers, which are software modules that control the operation of specific network devices](https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/networking/scaling.html)[1](https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/networking/scaling.html)[2](https://www.educba.com/linux-network-stack/).

The physical layer is responsible for transmitting and receiving bits over a physical medium. Examples of physical layer devices are cables, connectors, modems, etc. [The physical layer communicates with the data link layer through the device drivers](https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/networking/scaling.html)[1](https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/networking/scaling.html)[2](https://www.educba.com/linux-network-stack/).

#### <font color="green0"><u>What is MTU?</u></f>
[MTU stands for **Maximum Transmission Unit**, which is the size of the largest protocol data unit (PDU) that can be communicated in a single network layer transaction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maximum_transmission_unit)[1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maximum_transmission_unit). A PDU is a unit of data that contains both the header and the payload of a packet. The MTU depends on the type of network technology and can vary from one network to another. [For example, the MTU for Ethernet is 1500 bytes, while the MTU for PPPoE is 1492 bytes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maximum_transmission_unit)[2](https://homenetworkgeek.com/mtu-size/).

The MTU determines how much data can be sent in one packet over a network. If the data is larger than the MTU, it will be divided into smaller packets before being transmitted. This process is called fragmentation. Fragmentation can reduce the efficiency and speed of data transmission, as it requires more headers and acknowledgements. [Therefore, it is desirable to find the optimal MTU size for a network connection, which is the largest possible value that does not cause fragmentation](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/network-layer/what-is-mtu/)[3](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/network-layer/what-is-mtu/).

To find the optimal MTU size, you can use a ping command with different packet sizes and see if they are delivered without fragmentation. [You can also check the MTU settings on your router and your computer and adjust them if needed](https://homenetworkgeek.com/mtu-size/)[2](https://homenetworkgeek.com/mtu-size/). A higher MTU size can allow more data to be sent in fewer packets, which can improve the performance of your network. [However, a higher MTU size can also increase the risk of packet loss and delay, especially if there are errors or congestion in the network](https://www.imperva.com/learn/application-security/what-is-mtu-mss/)[4](https://www.imperva.com/learn/application-security/what-is-mtu-mss/).
