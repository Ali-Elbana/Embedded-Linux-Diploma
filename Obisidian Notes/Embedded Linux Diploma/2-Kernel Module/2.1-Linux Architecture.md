Let's first start with the basic knowledge of the Linux operating system.
## <font color="yellow"><u>Linux operating system:</u></font>

An operating system can be described as an interface among the computer hardware and the user of any computer. It is a group of software that handles the resources of the computer hardware and facilitates basic services for computer programs.

### <font color="yellow"><u>Kernel:</font></u>

The #kernel is the heart of the Linux operating system. It has complete control over everything in the system, such as managing hardware resources, running processes, handling interrupts, and providing system services. The kernel acts as a bridge between the software and the hardware of a computer, translating the requests from the applications into instructions for the devices. The kernel also protects the system from unauthorized access and errors by separating the user space and the kernel space, where different types of programs run.
### <font color="yellow"><u>System library:</font></u>

The #system_library is a collection of functions that are used to implement the functionality of the operating system. The system library provides an interface between the kernel and the user applications. It allows the applications to access the features and services of the kernel.
### <font color="yellow"><u>Shell:</font></u>

The #shell is an interface to the kernel that hides the complexity of the kernel’s functions from the users. It takes commands from the user and executes them by invoking the kernel’s functions. The shell can be either graphical or textual, depending on the user’s preference. There are different types of shells, such as bash, csh, ksh, and zsh.
### <font color="yellow"><u>Hardware layer:</font></u>

The #hardware_layer consists of all peripheral devices, such as RAM, HDD, CPU, etc., that are connected to the computer. The hardware layer communicates with the kernel through drivers, which are programs that control and manage the devices.

### <font color="yellow"><u>System utility:</font></u>

The #system_utility is a set of programs that provide various functionalities of the operating system to the user. Some examples of system utilities are file managers, text editors, network tools, backup tools, etc.
