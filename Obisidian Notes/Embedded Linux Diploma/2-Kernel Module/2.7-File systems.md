## <font color="yellow"><u>Definition of file:</u></f>

A file is a collection of digital data stored as a single object on a disk. The type of data stored in a file depends on its file type, typically consisting of text, images, multimedia audio and video streams, data libraries, executable software, or other information. A file can be identified by its filename, extension, and location in the disk’s file system.

A file can be created, opened, viewed, edited, copied, moved, renamed, deleted, or transferred using various software programs and commands. A file can also have different attributes, such as size, date, permissions, and ownership. A file can be associated with one or more programs that can open or execute it.

There are millions of files used with computers today that are identified either by the file extension or the file’s data. The file extension is a suffix that indicates the file type and format. For example, a file with the .TXT extension is a plain text file, while a file with the .PNG extension is a PNG image. The file’s data is the actual content of the file that can be read by the appropriate program or application.

## <font color="yellow"><u>File systems in Linux:</u></f>

The file system in Linux is a way of organizing and storing files on a storage device. It defines how the files are named, arranged, accessed, and managed by the operating system. Linux supports various types of file systems, such as ext4, XFS, Btrfs, FAT, and NTFS. [Each file system has its own advantages and disadvantages, such as performance, reliability, compatibility, and features](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/linux-file-system/)[1](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/linux-file-system/)[2](https://phoenixnap.com/kb/linux-file-system)
#### <font color="green0"><u>What is VFS:</u></f>

A virtual file system (VFS) in Linux is a software layer in the kernel that provides a common interface for user space programs to access different types of file systems, such as ext4, XFS, Btrfs, FAT, NTFS, etc. [The VFS also allows different file systems to coexist and interoperate within the kernel](https://opensource.com/article/19/3/virtual-filesystems-linux)[1](https://opensource.com/article/19/3/virtual-filesystems-linux)[2](https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/filesystems/vfs.html)

The VFS is needed because it simplifies the interaction between user space programs and file systems. Without the VFS, each program would have to implement its own logic and code to handle different file systems and their features. The VFS abstracts away the details of the underlying file systems and provides a uniform set of system calls, such as open(), read(), write(), stat(), etc., that can be used by any program to manipulate files and directories. [The VFS also handles the mounting and unmounting of file systems, the caching and buffering of data, the allocation and management of inodes and dentries, and the security and permissions of files and directories](https://opensource.com/article/19/3/virtual-filesystems-linux)[1](https://opensource.com/article/19/3/virtual-filesystems-linux)[2](https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/filesystems/vfs.html)[3](https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/v5.7/filesystems/vfs.html)

We can interact with the VFS using various tools and commands in Linux. For example, we can use the mount command to mount a file system on a specific directory, or the umount command to unmount it. We can use the ls command to list the files and directories in a file system, or the cp command to copy files between file systems. We can use the df command to check the disk space usage of a file system, or the du command to check the disk space usage of a file or directory. We can use the chmod command to change the permissions of a file or directory, or the chown command to change the owner and group of a file or directory. [We can also use various graphical tools or applications that provide a user-friendly interface for browsing and managing files and directories in different file systems](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/42176322/what-is-the-point-of-using-a-virtual-filesystem)[4](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/42176322/what-is-the-point-of-using-a-virtual-filesystem)

#### <font color="green0"><u>What is meant by mount and unmount a file:</u></f>

Mounting a file in Linux means attaching a file system to a directory in the Linux file system hierarchy, making it accessible to the user and the system. [Unmounting a file in Linux means detaching a file system from a directory, making it inaccessible and freeing up the resources used by it](https://linuxize.com/post/how-to-mount-and-unmount-file-systems-in-linux/)[1](https://linuxize.com/post/how-to-mount-and-unmount-file-systems-in-linux/)[2](https://www.howtogeek.com/414634/how-to-mount-and-unmount-storage-devices-from-the-linux-terminal/)

To mount or unmount a file in Linux, you can use the mount or umount commands, respectively. You need to specify the device name or the file name and the mount point (the directory where you want to attach or detach the file system). For example, to mount a file named test.iso as an ISO image to the /mnt directory, you can use this command:

```bash
sudo mount -o loop test.iso /mnt
```

To unmount the same file, you can use this command:

```bash
sudo umount /mnt
```

You can also use the /etc/fstab file to configure the file systems that are automatically mounted at boot time or when you use the mount command without any arguments. [The /etc/fstab file contains a list of entries that specify the device name, the mount point, the file system type, and other options for each file system](https://linuxize.com/post/how-to-mount-and-unmount-file-systems-in-linux/)[1](https://linuxize.com/post/how-to-mount-and-unmount-file-systems-in-linux/)[2](https://www.howtogeek.com/414634/how-to-mount-and-unmount-storage-devices-from-the-linux-terminal/)
