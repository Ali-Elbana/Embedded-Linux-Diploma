## <font color= "yellow"><u>History:</u></font>

The history of Embedded Linux dates back to the early 1990s when Linux itself was first developed by Linus Torvalds. The open-source nature of Linux made it an attractive choice for developers working on embedded systems due to its flexibility, stability, and modularity. Linux allowed developers to customize and optimize the operating system for their specific hardware requirements without the need to develop an entire operating system from scratch.

While bare metal programming can offer more deterministic performance and lower resource requirements, Embedded Linux provides a comprehensive software platform that simplifies development, accelerates time-to-market, and offers a wide range of features and capabilities. The choice between bare metal and Embedded Linux ultimately depends on the specific requirements and constraints of the embedded system being developed.
